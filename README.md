# CompilerConstruction
Creating a compiler, the syntax for the language is located in the documentation folder, although many parts of this compiler are non-working at the moment.

How to compile:
	Navigate to the directory /src/ and call
		make

How to run:
	Call in the /src/ directory
		./test.native

Running the program automatically runs all available tests and compares them to their expected outcome.

Test files are located in /src/tests/

Documentation on syntax and test files are in /documentation/
