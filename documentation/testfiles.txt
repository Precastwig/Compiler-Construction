This file lists all the test files and what they test in the language/compiler

All files should work with the outputprog function in test.ml
Otherwise it's proper output should be the one seen below.

basic1.ml - Comments, basic operand (+), assignment. 
	#Should return 10
basic2.ml - Sequential, other basic operands (-,/), assignment and returning. 
	#Should return 3
basic3.ml - if statements. 
	#Should return 7
basic4.ml - while loop. 
	#Should return 7
basic5.ml - read_int(), print_int(). 
	#Should return 5
basic6.ml - let, new. 
	#Should fail (let and new are not implemented for the evaltonum program)

bisection.ml - a bit of everything. 
	#Not imperitive so it should fail (or return some random number)

numtest1.ml - simple addition into no var
	#Should be 10
numtest2.ml - Assignment into variable then implicit dereference
	#Should be 4
numtest3.ml - Implicit dereference of a uninitialized variable, because the tests are all compiled together the dereference should be whatever last test used the variable x
	#Should be 2 (usually 0 though, dependent on what else has happened)
numtest4.ml - While loop with true and false
	#Should be 7

fibonacci.ml - gives the fibonacci number of index x (which is 5)
	#Should be 5
