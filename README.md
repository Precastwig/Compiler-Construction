# CompilerConstruction
Creating a compiler, the syntax for the language is located in the documentation folder, although many parts of this compiler are non-working at the moment.

How to compile: call *make* from the **src** directory

How to run: run *test.native* located in the **src** directory

Running the program automatically runs all available tests and compares them to their expected outcome.

Test files are located in /src/tests/
